  "companyHistory": "Our journey began in 1995 when Mr. Nitesh Kumar, a third-generation craftsman, decided to preserve and promote the traditional handicraft skills of his ancestors. Starting with just a small workshop and three artisans, he began creating handcrafted items for local markets.\n\nBy 2000, our reputation for quality had grown, and we expanded our operations to include more artisans and a wider range of products. We began participating in national trade fairs and exhibitions, where our products received widespread recognition.\n\nIn 2005, we took a significant step forward by establishing our first dedicated manufacturing facility. This allowed us to increase production capacity while maintaining the same high standards of craftsmanship. We also began exporting our products to international markets.\n\nBy 2010, Nitesh Handicraft had become a well-known name in the handicraft industry, with a presence in over 15 countries. We expanded our product range to include furniture, home decor, textiles, and traditional artifacts.\n\nIn 2015, we celebrated our 20th anniversary by launching our e-commerce platform, making our products accessible to customers worldwide. We also established training programs for young artisans to ensure the continuation of traditional skills.\n\nToday, in 2024, we continue to grow and innovate while staying true to our roots. We employ over 50 skilled artisans, serve customers in 25+ countries, and maintain our commitment to quality, authenticity, and cultural preservation.",
