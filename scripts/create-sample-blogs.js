3. Drying: Natural drying process to remove moisture
4. Firing: High-temperature firing in traditional kilns
5. Glazing: Application of natural glazes and decorative elements

Our pottery artisans use techniques passed down through generations, ensuring that each piece maintains the authentic character of traditional craftsmanship.

The beauty of handmade pottery lies in its uniqueness - no two pieces are exactly alike, making each item truly special.`,

Our weavers work on traditional looms, some of which have been in their families for generations. The patterns they create often tell stories of their culture and heritage.

The result is textiles that are not only beautiful but also incredibly durable and unique. Each piece carries the mark of the individual weaver, making it a true work of art.`,
